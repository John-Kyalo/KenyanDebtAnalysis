# Kenyan Debt Analysis Project

## Problem Statement
"An Analysis of Kenyan Debt Trends and Sustainability from September 1999 to December 2021"

Kenya's debt levels have been a growing concern, with both domestic and external debt contributing significantly to the country's financial obligations. Understanding the trends, composition, and sustainability of this debt is crucial for economic planning and policy formulation. However, there is a need for a comprehensive analysis that provides insights into the debt dynamics, evaluates the impact of government policies, and forecasts future debt levels. This project aims to address these needs by analyzing Kenyan debt data from September 1999 to December 2021, identifying key trends, assessing debt sustainability, and offering actionable recommendations for managing debt effectively.

## Analysis Goals

### Trend Analysis
- Analyze the trends in domestic debt, external debt, and total debt over time.
- Identify any patterns, seasonal variations, or significant changes in debt levels.

### Debt Composition
- Assess the proportion of domestic versus external debt.
- Examine how the composition of debt has changed over time.

### Debt Growth Rates
- Calculate the growth rates of domestic debt, external debt, and total debt.
- Identify periods of rapid increase or decrease in debt levels.

### Correlation Analysis
